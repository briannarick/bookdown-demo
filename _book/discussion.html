<p>Our inventory of ice-marginal lakes in Alaska from 1984 to 2019 demonstrates that lake area changes vary based on lake dam type and a lake’s topological position. By tracking individual lakes through time and categorizing lakes by dam type, region, and spatial relationship to their source glacier, we are able to identify trends that would otherwise be overlooked if lakes within Alaska were considered as a whole.</p>
<p>Overall, ice-marginal lakes in Alaska have grown in both number and area between 1984 and 2019, following the trend in both regional (Wang et al., 2013; Carrivick and Quincey, 2014; Nie et al., 2017; Song et al., 2017; Emmer et al., 2020) and global (Shugar et al., 2020) studies. However, ice-dammed lakes have decreased in number and area whereas moraine-dammed lakes have increased at a faster rate than the average when considering all dam types together. By examining individual lakes, we identify that the majority (56%) of lakes have not experienced a detectable area change over the period of study, and that 19 large (&gt;10km<sup>2</sup>), primarily moraine-dammed lakes contributed to 60% of total area growth. Analyzing all dam types together would fail to identify decreases in number and area of ice-dammed lakes, underestimate the increases in proglacial moraine-dammed lakes, and likely overestimate the importance of the appearance of small, supraglacial lakes.</p>

<p>Lake position and dam type, which are often linked, provide a simple, physically-based metric for parsing ice-marginal lakes in Alaska. The majority of moraine-dammed lakes are proglacial, located behind a Little Ice Age (LIA; ~1250–1850 AD) moraine at the front of a retreating glacier (e.g., Wiles et al., 1999; Santos and Córdova, 2009; Solomina et al., 2015, 2016). They tend to be associated with clean-ice glaciers (82%), defined by Brun et al. (2019) as &lt;19% debris cover (Fig. 9). The growth rate of moraine dammed lakes appears to be coupled to the amount of debris cover, as the lakes with the largest area increase are associated with clean-ice glaciers, with the exception of Vitus Lake at Bering Glacier (Fig. 9). Moraine-dammed lakes occur with both large and small glaciers, as most temperate glaciers can form a moraine during a period of advancement (e.g., the LIA), as long as sediment supply to the terminus is high. Basin geometry and glacier hypsometry likely play a large role in determining the lake expansion rate and maximum lake area, as the underlying bed slope influences how quickly the glacier retreats (depending on glacier mass balance; see Sect. 4.5). For example, large, coastal proglacial lakes can fill piedmont lobe basins (such as Vitus Lake, Malaspina Lake, and Grand Plateau Glacier Lake), which accommodate larger lake expansion than proglacial lakes confined to smaller, steeper valleys (Field et al., 2021). Basin geometry also determines the maximum lake level and the point at which the glacier detaches from the lake.</p>

<p>Ice-dammed lakes are primarily located next to clean-ice glaciers (65%), with larger, lower slope areas and positive hypsometric indices (bottom-heavy; Fig. 10), such as are found adjacent to Brady Glacier (Capps et al., 2011; Pelto et al., 2013). The largest lakes occur in tributary valleys, dammed by main branch ice, while many small lakes are found in pockets between glacier margins and valley walls. The decrease in ice-dammed lake number and area is likely due to the down-wasting of glacier surfaces (e.g., Larsen et al., 2015; Jakob et al., 2021), decreasing the height of the ice dam and therefore decreasing maximum area (and volume) of the lake (e.g., Kienholz et al., 2020). The formation of new conduits alongside or beneath the glacier could also be influencing ice-dammed lake drainage (e.g., Tulsequah Glacier; Neal, 2007; Post and Mayo, 1971). Previous work documented ice thinning as the primary factor in the loss of an ice dam for 82% of lakes lost from land-terminating glaciers and 62% of loss from lake terminating glaciers between 1971 and 2008 (Wolfe et al., 2014).</p>

<p>An overwhelming majority (&gt;80%) of bedrock-dammed lakes are associated with clean-ice glaciers less than 10 km<sup>2</sup> in area (Figs. 9 and 10). These types of lakes generally form within cirques, where a small glacier has retreated and exposed an overdeepening. Bedrock-dammed lakes can indicate an advanced stage of lake development (Emmer et al., 2020), such as is found in parts of the N Coast Ranges. Most bedrock-dammed lakes (&gt;90%) are either detached or unconnected, with minimal influence from ice-water contact. The small changes in area of unconnected bedrock-dammed lakes could be due to changes in the regional water balance rather than glacier dynamics.</p>
<p>Supraglacial lakes generally form on low-sloped debris-covered tongues of glaciers (Reynolds, 2000), where thin debris enhances melt and thick debris insulates ice and reduces surface melt (Östrem, 1959), often leading to heterogeneous surficial topography. Debris cover tends to reduce ice discharge and surface melt, leading to longer glaciers (Anderson and Anderson, 2016). The inventoried supraglacial lakes in Alaska follow these trends, with their distribution strongly skewed towards flat, bottom-heavy glaciers, as is characteristic of debris-covered glaciers (Reynolds, 2000). These lakes can occur on glaciers with any amount of debris cover, though have the highest concentration (64%) out of any lake dam type on glaciers with &gt;19% debris cover (Fig. 9). A majority of supraglacial lakes are located on a few large, heavily debris covered glaciers. For example, 95% of supraglacial lakes in the St. Elias Mountain region are located on two large, piedmont glaciers (Malaspina and Bering glaciers). Although these lakes are abundant, they exhibit high spatiotemporal variability and contribute minimally to total lake area (2–3%; Fig. 5).</p>
<p>Although additional factors are required to comprehensively assess GLOF hazards, a lake inventory that captures area and dam type provides a foundation for this type of assessment, as dam type influences stability, lake volume scales with area (e.g., Huggel et al., 2002; Cook and Quincey, 2015), and peak flood discharge scales with volume (e.g., Walder and Costa, 1996; Veh et al., 2020). Ice-dammed lakes are known to undergo multiple fill/drain cycles with the capability of producing multiple GLOFs (e.g., Anderson et al., 2003; Jacquet et al., 2017), whereas moraine-dammed lakes tend to only GLOF once, as their dam is typically compromised in the process. The observed decrease in number and area of ice-dammed lakes in Alaska suggests an overall decrease in GLOF hazards from these types of lakes, although the specifics of remaining lakes need to be evaluated individually (e.g., Suicide Basin, Kienholz et al., 2020; Tulsequh Glacier, Neal, 2007; Bear Glacier, Wilcox et al., 2014). The increase in number and area of moraine-dammed lakes provides a greater number of potential source lakes and a larger potential flood volume, however, factors such as surrounding slope stability (e.g., landslides, rockfalls, permafrost), moraine geometry and stability (e.g., slope, presence of an ice core), and downstream impacts must be evaluated first to determine GLOF potential and hazard (e.g., Worni et al., 2013; Rounce et al., 2017). As the nature of the dam type influences lake stability, the opposing trends of ice-dammed and moraine-dammed lakes complicates a region-wide assessment of changing GLOF hazards in the Alaska region.</p>

<p>The Alaska region of the RGI is separated into six second-order regions (see Fig. 8), used here as subregions for analysis. Lakes are most numerous in the N Coast Ranges (35% of all lakes) and St. Elias Mountains (27%), though these ranges also have the largest glacier area (24% and 41% of total ice in Alaska, respectively). Normalized lake frequency (number of lakes per 100 km<sup>2</sup> of glaciers) is highest in the Brooks Range, though it has the lowest normalized lake area (lake area per 100 km<sup>2</sup> of glaciers; 0.2) as total lake area sums to just 0.7 km<sup>2</sup> (Table 3). We interpret these normalized lake statistics as reflecting the late stage of ice-marginal lake development, minimal LIA glacier advance, as well as the relatively small glacier extent in the Brooks Range even during the Last Glacial Maximum (Kaufman and Manley, 2004). Normalized lake area is highest in the N Coast Ranges (1.7 km<sup>2</sup> per 100 km<sup>2</sup> of glaciers) due to the abundance of smaller glaciers and many proglacial lakes. The St. Elias Mountains have the largest total lake area; however, it also contains large icefields, which results in a similar normalized lake area as the Aleutians and the Chugach Mountains (1.5–1.6 km<sup>2</sup> per 100 km<sup>2</sup> of glaciers). This suggests that the area of ice-marginal lakes scales with glacier area in the coastal ranges (i.e., excluding the Brooks Range and Alaska Ranges), with normalized lake area ranging from 1.5 to 1.7.</p>
<p>Accounting for lake area change, the Brooks Range and Alaska Ranges have a small normalized lake area change (0.1–0.2; lake area change between 1984 and 2019 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> of glaciers). The Chugach, Aleutians, St. Elias, and N Coast Ranges, however, each have a higher normalized lake area change (0.6). These numbers suggest a dichotomy in which coastal glacier-lake systems are changing faster than those in more interior settings, in agreement with recent work investigating physical controls on ice-marginal lake area change (Field et al., 2021). The Alaska Ranges have the highest percent debris cover (19%), which could be a factor in the low normalized lake area and normalized lake area change seen in this region. Supraglacial lakes are the most abundant dam type in the Alaska Ranges (47% in 2016–2019), characterized by small areas and area changes (Table 2).</p>

<p>Rate of lake area change (km<sup>2</sup> per decade) through time indicates whether ice-marginal lake evolution has remained constant between different time periods, or whether the lakes have experienced periods of accelerated or decelerated change. Bedrock dammed lakes experienced little variation in rate of area change throughout the period of study (Fig. 11), with a rate that hovers around zero, likely due to the fact that a majority (&gt;90%) of bedrock-dammed lakes are either detached from their associated glacier or unconnected to any glacier. Ice-dammed lakes consistently experienced a negative median rate of area change, with the most negative rate of growth between 2007–2011 and 2016–2019. This implies drainage of ice-dammed lakes may be accelerating, which could be due to an increased rate of glacier thinning since 2013–2014 (Jakob et al., 2021), though this link requires further investigation. Supraglacial lakes exhibit the opposite trend, growing at a faster rate after 2007–2011 than they did prior. Moraine-dammed lakes experienced the largest median rate of change between 1984–1988 and 1997–2001. A decreasing median rate of change for moraine-dammed lakes yet large total area growth is likely due to the growth of a few large, outlier lakes whose influence is minimized by comparing median rather than mean rates of change. Proglacial lakes experienced the overall largest rate of growth, even when compared to all moraine-dammed lakes, suggesting that topological position, rather than strictly dam type, is a better indicator for rate of ice-marginal lake area change. Together, these data suggest the ice-marginal lakes of Alaska and northwestern Canada could be undergoing a transition, with an increased role of supraglacial lakes driving regional lake area expansion.</p>

<p>Alaska’s glaciers cover a large spatial extent, spanning different climatic, geologic, and glacial environments (Section 1). This makes the region particularly unique in relation to other glacierized regions, though the best analogue region depends on which Alaskan mountain range is considered. The heavily debris-covered areas (e.g., Alaska Ranges) have similar debris cover to the Himalaya, areas with clean-ice valley glaciers (e.g., N Coast Ranges) could behave similar to the Peruvian Andes, and the large and complex glaciers/icefields (e.g., St. Elias Mountains) have similar glacier and lake dynamics as the Patagonian Icefields. Dynamics within these Alaska subregions could shed light on ice-marginal lake behavior in comparable mountain ranges, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Many studies on ice-marginal lakes concentrate on High Mountain Asia (e.g., Nie et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Veh et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021), a region with abundant proglacial and supraglacial lakes, though HMA lakes tend to be smaller than Alaskan lakes (median lake area of 0.11 km<sup>2</sup> and 0.17 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively; Shugar et al., 2020). Alaska and the Himalaya regions (RGI regions 14, 15) have a similar percent debris cover (~15%), though Alaska contains larger glacier and debris-covered areas (Herreid and Pellicciotti, 2020). Herreid and Pellicciotti (2020) calculated a debris stage for each RGI region from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the ablation zone is entirely covered in debris. Debris stage is slightly higher in the Himalaya (~0.6–0.7) than Alaska (~0.5), though Alaska has a higher debris expansion potential (Herreid and Pellicciotti, 2020). This suggests that if debris cover expands in Alaska, these areas could become more similar to the heavily debris-covered areas in the Himalaya. Supraglacial lakes in the Himalaya vary considerably in location, shape and size, appearing, disappearing, and coalescing through time (Benn et al., 2001; Gardelle et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2017), behavior exhibited in Alaska as well. These similarities indicate that supraglacial lakes within these two regions have similar characteristics, and that understanding one region could aid in understanding the other.</p>
<p>Glacierized mountain ranges around the world exhibit varying stages of glacial retreat. The Peruvian Andes are considered to be in a late stage of glacier retreat with little potential for further lake expansion, as ice generally remains in steep, high elevation parts of the study area (Emmer et al., 2020). In Peru, glaciers have retreated far off their LIA moraines, such that the majority of proglacial lakes shifted from moraine dammed in 1948 to bedrock dammed in 2017 as glaciers retreated and exposed bedrock overdeepenings (Colonia et al., 2017; Emmer et al., 2020). Though ice remains in many main valleys in the N Coast Ranges, glaciers are smaller, steeper, cleaner, and less complex than other subregions in Alaska, apart from the Juneau Icefield. Though lakes in the N Coast Ranges are on average larger than those found in the low-latitude Andes (median lake area of 0.21 km<sup>2</sup> and 0.12 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively; Shugar et al., 2020), the abundance of moraine dammed proglacial lakes and increasing proportion of bedrock dammed lakes (39% in 1984–1988 to 44% in 2016–2019) suggests the N Coast Ranges could follow a similar trajectory as the Cordillera Blanca, producing a shift in dominant dam type from moraine to bedrock in the future.</p>
<p>Ice-marginal lake increases have been documented throughout the world, though characteristics such as dam type, lake location, and associated glacier behavior vary widely. Examining ice-marginal lake behavior at different stages in various mountain ranges can help predict how these lakes might evolve in the future, though such analysis is outside the scope of this study.</p>

<p>Lake geometry likely dictates the impact a proglacial lake has on glacier mass balance. Large, deep lakes can impede a glacier from reaching equilibrium by holding the terminus at lake elevation until it has retreated out of the lake basin (Larsen et al., 2015). Ice-water contact can also enhance calving, resulting in mass loss and lake expansion through terminus retreat (Carrivick and Tweed, 2013). Larsen et al. (2015) found that lake-terminating glaciers in Alaska have a more negative median mass balance in coastal regions where large, proglacial lakes have developed. Lake-terminating glaciers also experienced more rapid thinning near their terminus than land-terminating glaciers, and appear to be less directly coupled to climate variations (Larsen et al., 2015). In the Himalaya, lake-terminating glaciers have been linked with increased glacier mass loss through enhanced terminal retreat and surface lowering (King et al., 2019; Maurer et al., 2019), and center flow line velocities that are more than twice that of glaciers which terminate on land (Pronk et al., 2021). We therefore expect that as glaciers continue to retreat in Alaska, proglacial lake presence, formation, or detachment will influence glacier mass balance, increasing thinning and glacier velocity where lakes are present, though variations in thinning have been observed (e.g., the Juneau and Stikine icefields; Melkonian et al., 2014, 2016).</p>
<p>Regional glacier thinning and mass loss rates appear to mimic lake area change in parts of Alaska. The N Coast Ranges and St. Elias Mountains are thinning (–1.27 ± 0.11 m yr<sup>-1</sup> and –1.21 ± 0.12 m yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) and losing mass (–1.08 ± 0.09 m w.e. yr<sup>-1</sup> and –1.03 ± 0.10 m w.e. yr<sup>-1</sup>) at a greater rate than other subregions from 2011–2019 (Jakob et al., 2021). These regions also experienced the largest normalized lake area growth (see Sect. 4.2). The high thinning rate in the Aleutians (–0.75 ± 0.06 m yr<sup>-1</sup>) does not appear to be reflected in the low normalized lake area growth documented in our survey. This is likely due to the fact that 60% of lakes in the Aleutians subregion are either detached or unconnected and therefore not directly influenced by glacier dynamics. The Alaska Ranges are thinning (–0.48 ± 0.06 m yr<sup>-1</sup>) and losing mass (–0.41 ± 0.05 m w.e. yr<sup>-1</sup>) at the lowest average rates per region (Jakob et al., 2021) likely due to extensive debris cover, and is accompanied by the lowest normalized lake area change outside the Brooks Range.</p>

<p>As global temperatures continue to rise and glaciers thin and retreat (Zemp et al., 2019), Alaska’s glaciated landscape will change, as will the nature of ice-marginal lakes. Alaskan glaciers have retreated off their LIA moraines, and therefore it is unlikely that new moraine-dammed lakes will form without a sustained period of glacial advance or surge. However, proglacial lake expansion is expected to continue as glacier retreat accommodates lake growth, dependent on basin geometry. Using the Cordillera Blanca as an analogue for later stages of lake development (Emmer et al., 2020), we hypothesize a future shift in new proglacial lakes to mostly bedrock dammed lakes, as glaciers retreat into higher, steeper terrain (e.g., Linsbauer et al., 2016; Furian et al., 2021), though it is uncertain how long the present stage of moraine-dammed lake growth will persist before glaciers leave their terminal overdeepenings. Alaska’s glacier complexity and relative abundance of ice-dammed lakes poses an interesting question as to whether these lakes will continue to drain as they have since 1970 (Wolfe et al., 2014), or whether new ice-dammed lakes will form if tributary valley ice retreats faster than main branch ice, such as has occurred in Suicide Basin since 2011 (Kienholz et al., 2020). Modeling basin geometry and future ice extent would provide insight into where ice-marginal lakes in Alaska are likely to form in the future.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.7</span> Inventory challenges<a href="discussion.html#inventory-challenges" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Two primary challenges were encountered while creating the inventory, which should be understood before using this dataset or applying its findings. Due to the use of spectrally-based supervised classification for lake identification, only lakes that have the spectral characteristics of water appear within our inventory. This limitation results in the exclusion of some ice-dammed lakes which are either iceberg filled, or lake basins which appear dry in the five-year mosaics due to a lake that is more often drained than filled. Therefore, this inventory is a clear minimum of ice marginal lakes, with several known omitted lakes. Known lakes which were not identified in our inventory include Suicide Basin, Valdez Lake, Snow Lake, Lake Linda, and Summit Lake, all of which are ice-dammed. These lakes, which have experienced multiple drainage events (e.g., Jones and Wolken, 2019; Kienholz et al., 2020), are important for individual GLOF hazard assessments, though they have little impact (0.4% of total lake area) on our assessment of regional decadal scale lake area trends by dam type.</p>
<p>Dam type classification was performed using manual visual interpretation for all lakes, with the most likely dam type identified in cases that are uncertain due to poor image resolution and/or possible mixed dam types (i.e. bedrock with moraine material; Emmer et al., 2017). A shift in dam type (e.g., ice dammed to bedrock dammed) was also documented for a few lakes, particularly where a lake becomes bedrock dammed after the loss of an ice dam (e.g., Terentiev Lake which was formerly dammed by Columbia Glacier). These lakes were classified by their most recent dam type when performing analysis on change over time. The small number of cases of transitioning dam types suggests this process is not particularly important for understanding the regional scale behavior of Alaska ice-marginal lakes discussed here.</p>
