## Imagery and datasets

Cloud-free mosaics were compiled in Google Earth Engine (GEE), an open source, web-based remote sensing platform.  Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance Tier 1 images were used to create 5-year composites (Table 1). Intervals were selected based on available imagery and to capture average lake outlines for a five-year period within each decade (1980s to 2010s). Few images are available for the late 1980s to early 1990s, and therefore this time period was excluded. Imagery was limited to a 10 km buffer around the Randolph Glacier Inventory, with source imagery for glacier outlines mostly from 2004 to 2010 for Region 01 (RGI v6.0; RGI Consortium, 2017; Wang et al., 2012; Kienholz et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). For each pixel within the region of interest, the mosaicking algorithm calculates the median value of all cloud-free pixels between July 1st and September 31st for each year within the given time period (Fig. S1). Five-year mosaics minimize the impact of frequent cloud cover in Alaska, which complicates region-wide assessments on shorter timescales. In theory, 5-year composites allow for an average shoreline delineation, capturing longer term trends rather than seasonal variation. However, ice-dammed lakes are known to fill and drain on sub-annual (e.g., Lago Cachet Dos; Jacquet et al., 2017) to annual (e.g., Hidden Creek Lake; Anderson et al., 2003) timescales, so a lake may be characterized as persistent (present at every time step) even though it has undergone multiple fill/drain cycles between composites. Owing to this limitation, our focus here is on decadal changes in lake number and area, not sub-annual lake dynamics relevant for GLOF frequency.

## Generating lake inventories 1984 -- 2019

Image composites were classified in ArcGIS Pro using an object-based supervised classification (Support Vector Machine; Figure 2). Manual training samples were selected for snow, ice, water, bedrock, supraglacial debris, and vegetation for each individual time step as snow, ice, and water can vary from year to year. To reduce false positives from mountain shadows, which have a similar spectral signal as water (Fig. S3), a slope threshold of 10° was implemented (Zhang et al., 2018; Shugar et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021). We used a digital elevation model (DEM) composed of the national elevation dataset (NED; 10 m resolution) and Worldview-derived DEMs (resampled to 10 m resolution; DEMs created by the Polar Geospatial Center from DigitalGlobe, Inc. imagery). A minimum area threshold of 0.05 km^2^ (~55 pixels) excludes pixel-level noise and small lakes with minimal hydrological impact and GLOF potential (Carrivick and Quincey, 2014; How et al., 2021). Lakes with margins entirely outside a 1 km buffer from the RGI were eliminated to minimize the inclusion of lakes disconnected from a glacial system (Shugar et al., 2020). Wet, supraglacial debris bands are often misclassified as lakes, likely due to the presence of supraglacial water and therefore similar spectral properties (Fig. S4). A length to area threshold of 0.3 was implemented to remove these long and thin features with atypical lake shape. For this study, any lake within 1 km of the RGI was considered an ice-marginal lake, acknowledging that some low-lying lakes (e.g., Vitus Lake) may have tidal influence. Lakes which are within 1 km of the RGI and unconnected from a glacial system are noted (Sect. 2.3.2) and treated separately (Table 2).

All lake outlines were visually inspected and, if necessary, the lake margins were manually adjusted to produce a final delineation (Fig. S2). Lakes were added or excluded based on visual inspection and consideration of all four time steps together; lakes <0.05 km^2^ were manually added back in if the lake grew in subsequent years to minimize false signals of lake formation. Lakes which coalesced or separated over time were given the same Lake ID to minimize misclassification of a lake forming or draining. Every lake in each time step was then classified by i) dam type (Sect. 2.3.1), ii) topological position (Sect. 2.3.2), and iii) stability (Sect. 2.3.3).
